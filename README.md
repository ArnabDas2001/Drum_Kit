# Drum_Kit
 It is a simple drum kit web application that allows users to play drum sounds by clicking on-screen buttons or users also can do the same 
 by pressing some specific keys on their keyboard corresponding to those on-screen buttons.
 It's a fun web application to play around with, I made this project while learning javascript through the course being provided by 
 Dr.Angela Yu. Special thanks to her for guiding me through the whole process of this project.
